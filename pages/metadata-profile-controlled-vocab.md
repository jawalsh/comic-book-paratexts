# Project-specific controlled vocabularies for Comic Book Paratexts
## Paratext types

- [`advertisement`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:advertisement)
	- A commercial advertisment for a product or service. 
- [`postface`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:afterword)
- A concluding text, “consisting of discourse produced on the subjecte of the text that …precedes it.” (161)
- [`authorial epitext`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:authorial epitext)
- [`correspondence`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:correspondence)
	- Correspondence, typically between readers and publishers, editors, creators. Often found on “fan mail” or “letters of comment” pages in American comic books. 
- [`cover`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:cover)
- [`dedication`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:dedication)
- [`documentary epitext`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:documentary epitext) (remove)
- [`documentary paratext`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:documentary paratext) (remove)
- [`editorial`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:editorial)
- [`epigraph`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:epigraph)
- [`intertitle`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:intertitle)
- [`name of author`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:name of author)
- [`note`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:note)
- [`please-insert`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:please-insert)
    - A short text that summarizes the work to work it refers, originally separate sheets of paper inserted in a work for the benefit of potential reviewers. “A short text (generally between a half page and a full page) describing, by means of a summary or in some other way, and most often in a value-enhancing manner, the work to which it refers” (Genette, pp. 104-105).
- [`preface`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:preface)
	- An introductory text, “consisting of discourse produced on the subjecte of the text that follows … it.” (Genette, p. 161)
- [`public authorial epitext`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:public authorial epitext)
- [`publisher’s peritext`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:publisher’s peritext)
	-  Paratexts that may be attributed to the publisher (rather than the author/artist). Genette includes things like the size and format of a book, the series to which a book belongs, and the “cover and its appendages.” Of course, in comics the cover is not strictly a publisher’s paratext, but can include substantial content from the writer, artist, and other creators. Genette describes the publisher’d paratext as  
> the whole zone of the peritext that is the direct and principal (but not exclusive)
> responsibility of the publisher (or perhaps, to be more abstract
> but also more exact, of the publishing house) - that is, the zone
> that exists merely by the fact that a book is published and
> possibly republished and offered to the public in one or several
> more or less varied presentations. The word zone indicates that
> the characteristic feature of this aspect of the paratext is basically
> spatial and material. 
- [`solicitation`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:solicitation)

- [`title`](/cbp/search/index.html?q=paratext_type:title)
